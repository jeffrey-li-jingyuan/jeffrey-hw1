Hi Michael, <br />
In https://github.com/jeffrey-li-jingyuan/jeffrey-hw1/blob/master/bubbles-size.html, I switched the random size from (50, 100) to (12, 250) <br />
In https://github.com/jeffrey-li-jingyuan/jeffrey-hw1/blob/master/bubbles-movement.html, I switched the x and y axis movement from (-1, 1) & (-1, 1) to (-9, 9) & (-3,3)  <br />
In https://github.com/jeffrey-li-jingyuan/jeffrey-hw1/blob/master/bubbles-color.html, I switched the background color from 255 to 100, 120, 100: I switched the bubble colors and transparency from (255, 200, 200, 200) to (255, 0, 200, 30). <br />

PS: Since you did not make rules about what types of file should we upload, I kept the files in html format instead of Javascript, just thinking it might be eaiser to open.
